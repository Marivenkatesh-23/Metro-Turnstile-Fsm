# ðŸš‡ Metro Turnstile FSM

## Overview
This project implements a **Metro Turnstile Access Control System** using a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** in **Verilog**.  
The system simulates the logic of a metro gate that opens only when a valid access code is entered.  
It remains open for a short duration before automatically locking again.

## Tools Used
- **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)** â€“ Simulation  
- **VS Code** â€“ Code editing  
- **GTKWave** â€“ Waveform visualization

## Functional Description

| **State** | **Description** | **Condition / Action** | **Next State** |
|------------|----------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **IDLE** | Waiting for user input | Waits for `validate_code = 1` | CHECK_CODE |
| **CHECK_CODE** | Verifies access code | If `access_code` between `4` and `11` â†’ access granted | ACCESS_GRANTED |
| **ACCESS_GRANTED** | Gate open | Door open for 15 clock cycles | IDLE |

---

##  Design Highlights
- **3-State FSM (IDLE, CHECK_CODE, ACCESS_GRANTED)**  
- **Access verification logic** based on a numeric range (4â€“11)  
- **Automatic door close** after timer expires  
- **Asynchronous active-low reset (`rset`)**  
- **One clock-based timing mechanism** for simplicity

##  Simulation Output
Below is the waveform generated from the simulation showing the state transitions and door control signal:
